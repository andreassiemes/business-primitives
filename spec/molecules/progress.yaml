# Business Primitive: Progress
# A molecular unit tracking project or initiative progress.

bp: "1.0"
primitive: progress
type: molecule
composed_of: [metric, timeline, action]

description: >
  A progress report captures where a project or initiative stands
  relative to its plan. It combines the quantitative (metrics, velocity)
  with the structural (milestones, next actions) into a single,
  renderable unit.

fields:
  - name: checkpoint
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Where we stand right now

  - name: velocity
    type: string
    required: false
    description: Rate of progress (qualitative or quantitative)

  - name: forecast
    type: string
    required: false
    description: Projected completion or next milestone

  - name: blockers
    type: list
    required: false
    description: What is slowing progress (strings or inline risk primitives)

  - name: milestones
    type: list
    required: false
    description: Timeline primitives tracking key milestones

  - name: metrics
    type: list
    required: false
    description: Metric primitives tracking progress indicators

  - name: next_actions
    type: list
    required: false
    description: Action primitives for next steps

  primitive: progress
  id: prg-migration-kw12
  checkpoint: "Phase 2 of 4 complete. Data layer migrated, API layer in progress."
  velocity: "2 milestones per month (on plan)"
  forecast: "Full migration by KW 22 if current pace holds"

  metrics:
    - name: "Endpoints Migrated"
      value: 34
      unit: "of 78"
      period: "KW 12"
      direction: up
