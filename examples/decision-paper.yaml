title: "Platform Migration: Build vs. Buy"
author: "CTO"
date: 2026-03-01
deadline: 2026-03-15

context:
  primitive: argument
  claim: "Our current platform cannot scale beyond 10k concurrent users"
  evidence:
    - "Load tests show 8.2k user ceiling before degradation"
    - "Two production incidents in Q4 traced to scaling limits"
    - "Infrastructure costs growing 15% MoM with diminishing returns"
  implication: "We must either rebuild or migrate within 6 months"
  confidence: strong

options:
  primitive: comparison
  question: "Should we build a new platform in-house or buy/adopt an existing solution?"
  options:
    - name: "Build in-house"
      scores: { control: 9, time_to_market: 3, cost_12m: 4, risk: 5 }
    - name: "Adopt Platform X"
      scores: { control: 6, time_to_market: 8, cost_12m: 7, risk: 7 }
    - name: "Hybrid (core in-house, infra Platform X)"
      scores: { control: 8, time_to_market: 6, cost_12m: 6, risk: 6 }
  criteria:
    - { name: control, weight: 0.2 }
    - { name: time_to_market, weight: 0.35 }
    - { name: cost_12m, weight: 0.25 }
    - { name: risk, weight: 0.2 }
  recommendation: "Adopt Platform X — time-to-market is critical given scaling urgency"

risks:
  - primitive: risk
    description: "Vendor lock-in with Platform X"
    probability: medium
    impact: medium
    owner: "CTO"
    mitigation: "Abstraction layer for core APIs, contractual exit clause"

  - primitive: risk
    description: "Team resistance to external platform"
    probability: high
    impact: medium
    owner: "Engineering Lead"
    mitigation: "Involve senior engineers in evaluation, run 2-week spike"

decision:
  primitive: decision
  who: "CTO + Board"
  what: "Adopt Platform X with abstraction layer"
  date: 2026-03-15
  status: proposed
  rationale: "Best balance of speed and control. Hybrid was close second but adds complexity."
  alternatives:
    - "Full in-house build — rejected due to 9-month timeline"
    - "Hybrid approach — rejected as it combines risks of both options"

next_steps:
  - primitive: action
    who: "Tech Lead"
    what: "Run 2-week spike with Platform X sandbox"
    deadline: 2026-03-29
    status: open
    priority: critical

  - primitive: action
    who: "Legal"
    what: "Review Platform X contract terms"
    deadline: 2026-03-22
    status: open
    priority: high

  - primitive: timeline
    milestone: "Go/No-Go Decision"
    date: 2026-04-01

    dependencies:
      - "Spike completed"
      - "Contract reviewed"
    status: planned
