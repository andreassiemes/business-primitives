    primitives:
      - primitive: argument
        id: arg-platform-scaling
        claim: "Our current platform cannot scale beyond 10k concurrent users"
        evidence:
          - "Load tests show 8.2k user ceiling before degradation"
          - "Two production incidents in Q4 traced to scaling limits"
          - "Infrastructure costs growing 15% MoM with diminishing returns"
        implication: "We must either rebuild or migrate within 6 months"
        confidence: strong

    type: comparison
    primitives:
      - primitive: comparison
        id: cmp-build-vs-buy
        question: "Should we build a new platform in-house or buy/adopt an existing solution?"
        options:
          - name: "Build in-house"
            scores: { control: 9, time_to_market: 3, cost_12m: 4, risk: 5 }
          - name: "Adopt Platform X"
            scores: { control: 6, time_to_market: 8, cost_12m: 7, risk: 7 }
          - name: "Hybrid (core in-house, infra Platform X)"
            scores: { control: 8, time_to_market: 6, cost_12m: 6, risk: 6 }
        criteria:
          - { name: control, weight: 0.2 }
          - { name: time_to_market, weight: 0.35 }
          - { name: cost_12m, weight: 0.25 }
          - { name: risk, weight: 0.2 }
        recommendation: "Adopt Platform X — time-to-market is critical given scaling urgency"

    type: risk-register
    primitives:
      - primitive: risk

        probability: medium
        impact: medium

        mitigation: "Abstraction layer for core APIs, contractual exit clause"
        status: identified

      - primitive: risk
        id: rsk-team-resistance
        threat: "Team resistance to external platform"
        probability: high

        title: "Adopt Platform X with abstraction layer"
        decided_date: 2026-03-15
        status: proposed
        rationale: "Best balance of speed and control. Hybrid was close second but adds complexity."
        alternatives:
          - "Full in-house build — rejected due to 9-month timeline"
          - "Hybrid approach — rejected as it combines risks of both options"
